# Movie Review Website
### About
We are making movie based websites like IMDB and rotten tomatoes. The site will use the movies data
set and perform different functionalities. The website will show a list of movies along with their posters
on its main web page. The site will allow user registration and will keep a record of user information.
The website will also hold the features of movie rating, wish list, watched list.

1. Display latest movies
2. Display movie detail i.e. genre, cast, review, overview.
3. Displays similar movies
4. User can add review (local)
5. User profiling (local)
6. User can add movie (local)
### Data
We used the API of <a href='https://www.themoviedb.org/'>TMDB - The Movie Data Base</a> to fetch data for the website. In order to do that an API key is required which I get after creating account on TMDB and place API key request.
### Server
We used XAMP to run our website locally.
### DataBase
SQL file is in project file.
### Note
* We used a template for this website but unfortunately lost the reference link and changed file name. So, we will update this information as soon as possible.
* If API key don't work then register in TMDB and apply for API key. The API key used in the project is from my personal account.
